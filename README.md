# Machine Learning Regression Algorithms

This repository contains an overview of common regression algorithms used in machine learning. Each algorithm helps to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Types of Regression Algorithms

### 1. Linear Regression
Linear Regression models the relationship between the dependent and independent variables using a straight line.

### 2. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems and predicts the probability of a binary outcome.

### 3. Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression models the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables.

### 4. Polynomial Regression
Polynomial Regression extends linear regression by fitting a polynomial equation to the data, modeling non-linear relationships.

### 5. Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression introduces a penalty term to the linear regression to reduce overfitting by shrinking the coefficients.

### 6. Lasso Regression
Lasso Regression is similar to ridge but uses an L1 penalty to shrink coefficients, and can set some coefficients to zero for feature selection.

### 7. Elastic Net Regression
Elastic Net combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties, balancing the strengths of both regularization methods.

## How to Use
Each algorithm can be applied to different types of regression problems based on the dataset and requirements. For implementation, use Python libraries like Scikit-Learn or Statsmodels.
